          Psychology is the science of mind and behavior. Psychology includes
          the study of conscious and unconscious phenomena, including feelings
          and thoughts. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing
          the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Psychologists
          seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking
          the discipline to neuroscience. As a social science, psychologists aim
          to understand the behavior of individuals and groups.Ψ (or psi) is a
          Greek letter which is commonly associated with the science of
          psychology. A professional practitioner or researcher involved in the
          discipline is called a psychologist. Some psychologists can also be
          classified as social, behavioral, or cognitive scientists. Some
          psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in
          individual and social behavior. Others explore the physiological and
          biological processes that underlie cognitive functions and behaviors.
          Psychologists are involved in research on perception, cognition,
          attention, emotion, intelligence, subjective experiences, motivation,
          brain functioning, and personality. Psychologists' interests extend to
          interpersonal relationships, psychological resilience, family
          resilience, and other areas within social psychology. They also
          consider the unconscious mind.Research psychologists employ empirical
          methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between
          psychosocial variables. Some, but not all, clinical and counseling
          psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation. While psychological
          knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental
          health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving
          problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts,
          psychology ultimately aims to benefit society.Many psychologists are
          involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical,
          counseling, or school settings. Other psychologists conduct scientific
          research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and
          behavior. Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic
          settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, hospitals). Another
          group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational
          settings. Yet others are involved in work on human development, aging,
          sports, health, forensics, and the media.

        <h2>Etymology and definitions</h2>
        <p>
          The word psychology derives from the Greek word psyche, for spirit or
          soul. The latter part of the word "psychology" derives from -λογία
          -logia, which refers to "study" or "research".The Latin word
          psychologia was first used by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko
          Marulić in his book, Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae
          (Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul) in the late 15th century
          or early 16th century.The earliest known reference to the word
          psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical
          Dictionary. The dictionary refers to "Anatomy, which treats the Body,
          and Psychology, which treats of the Soul."In 1890, William James
          defined psychology as "the science of mental life, both of its
          phenomena and their conditions."This definition enjoyed widespread
          currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by
          radical behaviorists such as John B. Watson, who in 1913 asserted that
          the discipline is a "natural science," the theoretical goal of which
          "is the prediction and control of behavior."Since James defined
          "psychology," the term more strongly implicates scientific
          experimentation.Folk psychology refers to the understanding of
          ordinary people, as contrasted with that of psychology professionals,
          with regard to the mental states and behaviors of people.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            The ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Persia
            all engaged in the philosophical study of psychology. In Ancient
            Egypt the Ebers Papyrus mentioned depression and thought disorders.
            Historians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato,
            and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima treatise),addressed the
            workings of the mind.As early as the 4th century BC, the Greek
            physician Hippocrates theorized that mental disorders had physical
            rather than supernatural causes. In 387 BCE, Plato suggested that
            the that the brain is where mental processes take place, and in 335
            BCE Aristotle suggested that it was the heart. In China,
            psychological understanding grew from the philosophical works of
            Laozi and Confucius, and later from the doctrines of Buddhism. This
            body of knowledge involves insights drawn from introspection and
            observation, as well as techniques for focused thinking and acting.
            It frames the universe in term of a division of physical reality and
            mental reality as well as the interaction between the physical and
            the mental. Chinese philosophy also emphasized purifying the mind in
            order to increase virtue and power. An ancient text known as The
            Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine identifies the brain
            as the nexus of wisdom and sensation, includes theories of
            personality based on yin–yang balance, and analyzes mental disorder
            in terms of physiological and social disequilibria. Chinese
            scholarship that focused on the brain advanced during the Qing
            Dynasty with the work of Western-educated Fang Yizhi (1611–1671),
            Liu Zhi (1660–1730), and Wang Qingren (1768–1831). Wang Qingren
            emphasized the importance of the brain as the center of the nervous
            system, linked mental disorder with brain diseases, investigated the
            causes of dreams and insomnia, and advanced a theory of hemispheric
            lateralization in brain function.

        <h2>Disciplinary organization</h2>
        <h3>Institutions</h3>
        <p>
          In 1920, Édouard Claparède and Pierre Bovet created a new applied
          psychology organization called the International Congress of
          Psychotechnics Applied to Vocational Guidance, later called the
          International Congress of Psychotechnics and then the International
          Association of Applied Psychology.[30] The IAAP is considered the
          oldest international psychology association. Today, at least 65
          international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology. In
          response to male predominance in the field, female psychologists ina
          the U.S. formed the National Council of Women Psychologists in 1941.
          This organization became the International Council of Women
          Psychologists after World War II and the International Council of
          Psychologists in 1959. Several associations including the Association
          of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological
          Association have arisen to promote the inclusion of non-European
          racial groups in the profession. The International Union of
          Psychological Science (IUPsyS) is the world federation of national
          psychological societies. The IUPsyS was founded in 1951 under the
          auspices of the United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific
          Organization (UNESCO). Psychology departments have since proliferated
          around the world, based primarily on the Euro-American model. Since
          1966, the Union has published the International Journal of Psychology.
          IAAP and IUPsyS agreed in 1976 each to hold a congress every four
          years, on a staggered basis. IUPsyS recognizes 66 national psychology
          associations and at least 15 others exist. The American Psychological
          Association is the oldest and largest. Its membership has increased
          from 5,000 in 1945 to 100,000 in the present day. The APA includes 54
          divisions, which since 1960 have steadily proliferated to include more
          specialties. Some of these divisions, such as the Society for the
          Psychological Study of Social Issues and the American Psychology–Law
          Society, began as autonomous groups.[64] The Interamerican
          Psychological Society, founded in 1951, aspires to promote psychology
          across the Western Hemisphere. It holds the Interamerican Congress of
          Psychology and ha had 1,000 members in year 2000. The European
          Federation of Professional Psychology Associations, founded in 1981,
          represents 30 national associations with a total of 100,000 individual
          members. At least 30 other international organizations represent
          psychologists in different regions. In some places, governments
          legally regulate who can provide psychological services or represent
          themselves as a "psychologist." The APA defines a psychologist as
          someone with a doctoral degree in psychology.

        <h3>Boundaries</h3>
        <p>
          Early practitioners of experimental psychology distinguished
          themselves from parapsychology, which in the late nineteenth century
          enjoyed popularity (including the interest of scholars such as William
          James). Some people considered parapsychology to be part of
          "psychology." Parapsychology, hypnotism, and psychism were major
          topics at the early International Congresses. But students of these
          fields were eventually ostractized, and more or less banished from the
          Congress in 1900–1905. Parapsychology persisted for a time at Imperial
          University in Japan, with publications such as Clairvoyance and
          Thoughtography by Tomokichi Fukurai, but it was mostly shunned by
          1913. As a discipline, psychology has long sought to fend off
          accusations that it is a "soft" science. Philosopher of science Thomas
          Kuhn's 1962 critique implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm
          state, lacking agreement on the type of overarching theory found in
          mature sciences such as chemistry and physics. Because some areas of
          psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and
          questionnaires, critics asserted that psychology is not an objective
          science. Skeptics have suggested that personality, thinking, and
          emotion cannot be directly measured and are often inferred from
          subjective self-reports, which may be problematic. Experimental
          psychologists have devised a variety of ways to indirectly measure
          these elusive phenomenological entities. Divisions still exist within
          the field, with some psychologists more oriented towards the unique
          experiences of individual humans, which cannot be understood only as
          data points within a larger population. Critics inside and outside the
          field have argued that mainstream psychology has become increasingly
          dominated by a "cult of empiricism," which limits the scope of
          research because investigators restrict themselves to methods derived
          from the physical sciences. Feminist critiques have argued that claims
          to scientific objectivity obscure the values and agenda of
          (historically) mostly male researchers. Jean Grimshaw, for example,
          argues that mainstream psychological research has advanced a
          patriarchal agenda through its efforts to control behavior.
